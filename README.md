# *TV Script Generator* - Recurrent Neural Network

This project is a part of [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

*Submitted: Aug 2019*

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a neural network that generate a **new** TV script for [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) sitcom.

### Methods Used
* Recurrent Neural Network (**RNN**)
* Long Short Term Memory (**LSTM**)
* Pattern Recognition
* Many-to-one sequence mapper

### Technologies
* Python
* PyTorch

### Training Data
The data used to train this RNN is [Seinfeld Chronicles](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) transformed into a *.txt* file. The original dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) contains scrips from all seasons of this sitcom and is available in form of a *.csv* file.
